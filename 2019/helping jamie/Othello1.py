#Plays the bored game of Othello (Reversi)
#Stones are placed on a grid. If you surround the stones of your opponent 
#in a straight line the stones are flipped (or reversed). The game is played 
#until there are no more legal moves. Stones can only be placed adjacently 
#to other stones. This game is played between a human player and a computer
