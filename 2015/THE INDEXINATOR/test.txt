Hickory dickory dock
The mouse ran up the clock
The clock struck one 
The mouse ran down 
Hickory Dickory Dock

Oh the grand old Duke of York
He had ten thousand men
He marched !@#$%^&**()_+=-098765432 1:56 PM 10/11/2015 them up to the top of the hill 
And he marched them down again
And when they were up they were up
And when they were down they were down
And when they were only halfway up
They were neither up nor down

Jack and Jill went up the hill 
To fetch a pail of water
Jack fell down and broke his crown
And happy his dentist was after
